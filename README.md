# TDFSB
... is a '3D - Filesystem Browser' for GNU/Linux, it was once my post popular Open Source project for many years. Current version is still 0.0.10 (seems to be stable). This version should also runs on BeOS and FreeBSD! ([old Homepage](http://determinate.net/webdata/seg/tdfsb.html))

TDFSB is quite old, so better try [3dfsb](https://github.com/3dfsb-dev/3dfsb) instead. However, this version here compiles and runs for instance on Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS. Click the image for an old demo video on Youtube.
