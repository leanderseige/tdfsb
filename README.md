# TDFSB
... is a '3D - Filesystem Browser' for GNU/Linux. Current version is 0.0.10 (seems to be stable). This version should also run on BeOS and FreeBSD!

TDFSB is quite old, so better try [3dfsb](https://github.com/3dfsb-dev/3dfsb) instead. However, this version here compiles and runs for instance on Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS.
